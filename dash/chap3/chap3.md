良い視覚とは
- First, visible light reflects off every surface in the known universe.
•	 Our eyes capture this light from within our surrounding environment, turn it into
information, and then send it to our brains using the optic nerve as a channel.
•	 At the end of the optic nerve is the optic chiasm, where the optic nerves from both
eyes meet. Here, the information is sent into our brains to be processed.
